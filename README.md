# snackbar
Order some menu items at the Beach Burger Shack!

## What is snackbar?
Implementing a program like snackbar is a great way to practice using structs in C. *snackbar.c* allows users to order items via the command-line and calculates their total cost. 
A similar program could be implemeneted on a company website, simply plugging in their items and costs. This program was developed for a course assignment while studying in college.

## Usage
In order to run the program, users will need to download the [CS50 library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/releases) and follow these [instructions](https://github.com/madison-nicole/libcs50). The code must then be compiled.

Enter "./snackbar" then order items as prompted.
